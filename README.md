# Code from paper: Detecting consciousness with functional near-infrared spectroscopy and tongue motor imagery: a proof-of-concept study

Code includes loading, preprocessing, plotting, and statistical analysis of fNIRS data during a tongue motor imagery task. Includes analysis for healthy control (HC) and patients (PT), who have a range of disorders of consciousness. 

The code requires functions (based on HOMER2) and custom scripts, which can be found in previous code from a published paper in PNAS (https://github.com/TheOwenLab/fNIRS_ICU_PNAS-).
